**Healthcare access** in the United States is a topic that affects every individual residing in our country, so it is important to think about ways that we can create a system that provides for every individual. With our population being so spread out, oftentimes some individuals may have to travel hours in order to receive proper care.

## Rural and Urban Inequalities
One of the most obvious ways that the problem of healthcare access manifests itself is in the rural and urban divide. By nature, those living in more rural areas may have to travel hours to the nearest hospital to get treated. This can be detrimental in time sensitive emergencies.

## Access for individuals with rare diseases
Another group of individuals that are affected by this problem of geographical healthcare access are individuals who contract more rare forms of disease, that require very specific forms of treatment. This means that individuals may have to spend multiple hours, multiple times a year in order to travel to institutions with the means to treat their disease.

### Specialized Cancer Treatment
One example of this would be the treatment of rare forms of cancer. Institutions such as Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington, is oftentimes the destination for many individuals seeking treatment for specific forms of cancer treatment from all over the world [1]. Because of the specificity of some types of diseases, many individuals must travel hundreds of miles in order to attain access to certain types of treatments. This is important when thinking about which individuals have access to the economic capital to make these trips, and who is left behind and is unable to gain access to treatment that would help their disease.

## Neighborhood/Regional Specific Barriers
Another way that the problem of healthcare access prevents itself is in specific neighborhoods and regions that may have a lack of clinics or hospitals. Areas that have received less development or are of lower income, tend to have poorer quality of heatlhcare facilities [2].
